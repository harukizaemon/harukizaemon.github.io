While reading [A case against Annotations](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=36110), I couldn't help but laugh-out-loud at [this](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=36110#182363) particular response:

> RoR is quickly becoming the [Godwin's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law) of Java language related discussions:<br /><br />"As an online Java discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Ruby or RoR approaches 1 (i.e. certainty)." -- Marc Stock

Some others off the top of my head:

* Any editor and Emacs;
* Any programming language and Smalltalk;
* Windows and Linux;
* ...?

Having never heard of the _Law_ before, I did a bit of reading and found, among other things, an [FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/legends/godwin/) and a [paper](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if_pr.html) by Mike Godwin himself.
