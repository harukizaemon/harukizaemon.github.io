I can take it no longer. If I hear or read about how Getting Things Done (GTD) saved yet another person's "life" I'm going to scream. This fascination the world (and geeks in particular) have with doing more and more stuff is frightening.

When you feel there is just so much to do in your life that you can't seem to make it through the day without stressing about something, that your life is spiralling out of control and there seems to be nothing you can do about it, there is an alternative course of action: DLS - Do Less Stuff&trade;

Yes, hard to believe but there is actually no particular need to devise yet more processes in order to deal with the stuff that is ultimately controlling you. Instead, you can _actually_ take control of your life and say "I'm going to do less stuff" and tell those that would foist their agendas upon you to go jam it.

I choose not to reduce my life (and the enjoyment thereof) to a series of [prioritised index cards pinned to a wall](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikemason_ca/429498371/).
