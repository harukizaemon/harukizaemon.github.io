I just received a message from a reader:

> Hey I just wanted to let you know I really enjoy your blog but I've been getting lots of duplicate copies of your posts in my RSS reader (Newsgator), I don't know if this is because you repeatedly modify your posts? And now I've gotten another copy of all your posts back to Nov 28 so I have to find them all to mark them as read. So I unsubscribed (But I should still receive your posts from javablogs.com I guess if it is still in operation :).

I had no idea this would happen. Doh! Some technologist I am LOL.

So to my question: is there a way to not have it behave this way? Or should I just stop editing my blog? Hehehe. I continually update it to correct spelling mistakes and typos in code examples, etc. So that seems like a rather crappy solution. Or maybe I should just move to a wiki with an RSS feed? Any idea?

I'd hate to think how many others are frustrated with seeing the same stuff appearing over and over again.

And you all rock! I hope this works but the solution seems very simple:

> It's a stupid feature of newsgator that is on by default. Whenever a blog entry is modified it's sent to the user as a new blog entry. It is easily turned off in the options, but I believe the user needs to configure this for each rss feed.
