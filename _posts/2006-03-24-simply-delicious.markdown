Like just about everyone these days, I have a [Delicious account](http://del.icio.us/haruki_zaemon). (For those of you still living in early 2005, it's a [social bookmarking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking) site.) I use it whenever I have a link to something that I want to remember personally and also for links that I would have blogged about but for which I don't feel a blog is really the appropriate medium.

One feature I love about deli.cio.us (yes that is the correct spelling) is the inbox. If you haven't looked at it, it's a great way to keep track of other peoples bookmarks. So, rather than subscribe to individual bookmark feeds, you can instead add each feed to your inbox and then subscibe to your own inbox. This way you get all the feeds in one shot and it also lets others see what bookmarks you are interested in.

So, if you're remotely interested in checking out things that I'm interested in or things I think you might be interested, it's easy to [subscribe to my own links](http://del.icio.us/rss/haruki_zaemon) or even [subscribe to my inbox](http://del.icio.us/rss/inbox/haruki_zaemon) to see links other people have that interest me.
