If you haven't heard already, [Cogent Consulting](http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/) are recruiting.

Cogent Consulting prides itself on the depth of its experience with agile software  development, and its ability to leverage this experience to benefit Cogent clients. We are an open-book company, with comprehensive employee participation in decision-making.

What do we do? We’re a three part story. We go out on site as consultants to help our clients get better at producing good software, by both coaching them in agile techniques and working as integral part of their development teams. We produce high-quality websites  for clients from our own premises. Finally, we build our own (mostly web-based) products, using the range of great talents that make up our team.

Right now we’re looking for people who can perform hands-on web application development both in our offices and on client sites, predominantly in Ruby on Rails.

We're also looking for people who can provide hands-on support to clients undertaking agile transformations at both the small and large scale, as well as help out with internal product development

In either case You’ll need to show us that you:

* understand the principles of agile software development and have experience working on agile projects
* are collaborative, but willing to be a benevolent dictator when required
* can represent us on a client site in a way that makes us proud
* have a passion for software development and you continue your professional development outside of work hours
* have experience with Ruby on Rails, or you are able to learn it very quickly. Extra points if you’re a Smalltalk or Haskell expert
* understand that “done” means the software is in production
* have a demonstrated track record of successful delivery
* have a passion for software development and you continue your professional development outside of work hours
* think that the time after five o’clock belongs to your family (yes, that’s contradictory - we want to know how you deal with that contradiction)
* understand that software and process should be opinionated, but not bigoted
* can read, you choose to read, and you understand what you read
* are intellectually omnivorous
* consider communication (written and verbal) to be amongst your strongest skills

In return, we’ll provide you with a collegial environment that rewards inquisitiveness rather than being an ongoing inquisition. We’ll treat you as part of the Cogent family, and give you a share of the profit and/or the products that we develop. We’ll provide an environment where you can work with your peers, be challenged, and be the best that you can be.

If this sounds like your thing, you can visit our [website](http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/) for more information about Cogent, or email us directly: <a href="mailto:info@cogentconsulting.com.au">info@cogentconsulting.com.au</a>
