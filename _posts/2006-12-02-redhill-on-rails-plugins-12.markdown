With the pending release of Rails 1.2, I've taken the opportunity to begin updating the plugins to take advantage of various 1.2 features such as `alias_method_chain` and to remove where possible, work-arounds for bugs that have been fixed. So, as of today, the trunk will only run against Rails 1.2.

For those not lucky or perhaps not foolish enough to start using the latest and greatest that Rails has to offer, you can find all the Rails 1.1.6 compatible versions of the plugins at: <svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/redhillonrails/tags/release-1.1.6/vendor/plugins>

Enjoy!
