When I moved to FeedBurner I hardly ever used delicious and I thought it might be interesting to have any new links included as part of my feed. These days however, I find myself adding links to delicious on a regular basis and my feed has been somewhat flooded as a consequence. So, by request, I've removed the links from the feed. You can always subscribe to them using delicious anyway if you really cared (not that you probably did).
