So [Phil](http://www.mikemelia.com/) asks me why I haven't blogged in so long. The quick answer is: I haven't had anything much to enrage me recently and consequently I haven't had much if anything to blog about. (It's amazing what time away from a computer does for ones mental health.)

The I receive this email:

> `Dear eBay Member: kwikdigital has informed us that they have not yet received your payment for the following item:CANON IR 8500 w/ NetworkPrinter +K3N FINISHER 85PPM - (#7557660205) No action is being taken against your account at this time. However, it is important to remember that when you bid on or buy an item you are agreeing to a contract between you and the seller. If the situation isn't resolved within 7 days of this reminder, you may receive an Unpaid Item strike under eBay's Unpaid Item Policy. If you don't respond by Mar-03-2006 you may receive an Unpaid Item strike. Most Unpaid Item disputes can be resolved through direct communication between the buyer and seller, and we encourage you to work with your trading partner to reach a resolution. Regards, eBay`

Only I'm not an eBay member; never have been; don't seem myself ever becoming one. So I do the "right" thing and forward it to `abuse@ebay.com` and for my efforts I receive another email:

> `Thank you for writing to the eBay SafeHarbor Team.

Which is all very well and good but I'M NOT AN EBAY MEMBER.

So I follow the link provided to "report spoof" only to be confonted by a series of questions which I dutifully answer and eventually end up on a page telling me how, as an eBay member, I can:

* Know that an email is really from eBay
* Tell if Email and websites are impersonating eBay; or
* An overview of what to do if I suspect account theft

Which would be realy helpful except I wouldn't have bothered to come here if I didn't already suspect some kind of fraud because, well geee, I'M NOT AN EBAY MEMBER.

Scouring the page a littlke I found, among all these options, an "Email Us" link which of course I cheerfully click on only to be confronted by a screen asking me to Sign-In which as you know by now is not possible because: I'M NOT AN EBAY MEMBER!

However, being the kind souls that they are, there is also another button marked "Register, it's fast and **free**."

So it would seem that to contact eBay in order to inform them that their system is being used to send unsolicted email to someone who IS NOT AN EBAY MEMBER requires me to become an eBay member. Hmmmm.

Thankfully, it's even easier and "free'r" to configure my email software to block anything coming from eBay.
