I've been using [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) for sometime now and while it does a good job of moderating the spam, I'd rather it didn't even get that far. So in a last ditch effort to eradicate comment spam all together, I've just installed a [different kind of solution](http://james.seng.cc/archives/000145.html). This plugin puts up a security code graphic that you must enter in order to submit the comment. Although there have been some complaints about this technique on the grounds that it is discrimatory towards people with impaired vision, I'm going to give a whirl anyway and see how it goes. Apparently the guy who wrote the plugin has also recently written a [bayesian filter](http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/bayesian.php) as well but personally, like with MT-Blacklist, I don't have the time to sift through all the comments, deleting the spam.

Update: 1st November 2004 - Seems to be working a treat. I've had not one blog spam comment in the last 24 hours but people have successfully commented manually. I usually get around 6-10 spam comments in the same period.</p.

Update: 4th November 2004 - It's amusing to look at my web logs and see all the access attempts from dodgy sites, no doubt attempting to post comment spam and failing dismally!
