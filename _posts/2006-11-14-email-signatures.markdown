I've always liked the subtitle to [Charles Miller's blog](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/):

```
> tail -f /dev/mind &gt; blog
```

Today, my brother was reading through some [KDE newsgroups](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=37041) and came across this as the signature to one of the messages:

```
> # cd /usa/whitehouse# rm -rf *
```

Ahhh geek humour!
