My mate [Marty Andrews](http://www.martyandrews.net/blog) is running a [Design Improvement Workshop](http://www.cogent.co/services/designImprovement.html) on March 24th here in Melbourne as part of Cogent's [Easy Access Training (EAT)](http://www.cogent.co/services/eat.html). The content is in part, a follow on to the [TDD Workshop](http://www.cogent.co/services/tdd.html) with emphasis on identifying and removing code smells using refactoring tools and techniques.

One interesting point about these courses is that rather than being a fixed price, places are allocated by auction with the final price determined by the lowest bid! So, if you think some first-class developer training is worth $100, get in quick before you're outbid.
