I have no idea which crack smoking monkeys thought this was a good idea. Talk about clash of the namespaces. Has no one ever tried to use `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date` in the same class? But while we're at it, can we have pointer arithmetic back as well? Ooo...ooo...how about C#-like properties. Yeah! You know, I'd really like to be able to embed java-byte code directly into my source using some kind of assembler-like syntax too. Imagine how cool that would be!

I take comfort in the fact that large organisations (for whom I'm most concerned) are so slow to move, their developers won't see JDK 1.5 for at least the next 3 years hehehe.

Oh well. I can see a new [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sf.net) plugin coming real soon.
