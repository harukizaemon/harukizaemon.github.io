I admit to having been influenced greatly by much of [Martin Fowlers](http://www.martinfowler.com) writing over the years. It's always thought provoking at the very least but [this entry](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AppealToAuthority.html) on his [bliki](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki) made me do a "What The?"

> There is no way I (or any other software loud-mouth) has that much influence.

There is no way _I_ can believe that _he_ actually believes this. Clearly, people such as Martin _do_ have that much influence. That's why they are employed by organisations such as [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com). That's why they draw huge crowds at conferences. That's why developers the world over buy their books.

So maybe we could re-phrase that sentence? Perhaps it should read:

> There is no way I (or any other software loud-mouth) **should have** that much influence.

But the fact remains that he (and other software loud-mouths) do and as a consequence lots of people will blindly do exactly what they say. The operative word here being _blindly_.

He is quite right though. People are selective when appealing to authority and people as a whole should take more responsibility for their own thinking.
