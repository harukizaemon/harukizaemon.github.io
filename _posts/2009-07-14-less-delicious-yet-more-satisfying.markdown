These days, I spread my research and reading between [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). IMHO, [delicious](http://delicious.com/) is essentially a big old shed with crap in it and no way to actually use any of it other than marvel at how much stuff I've collected.

On the other hand, both Instapaper and Evernote add value to the stuff I've collected: Instapaper allows me to read blogs and websites on my phone, and Evernote allows me to collect and organise information according to project, tags, etc.

As [Travis](http://www.prozacblues.com/) pointed out, this makes it difficult (nay impossible) for others to see what I'm reading and is largely the reason I send out almost daily emails to colleagues on stuff I think is more generally interesting.

This morning I noticed that Instapaper helpfully provide a read-only feed of my list. So, for anyone interested, here is the link: [http://www.instapaper.com/rss/175381/1rDOvQp1xwBTeMIoml2TuzPjlmM](http://www.instapaper.com/rss/175381/1rDOvQp1xwBTeMIoml2TuzPjlmM)

**Update:**If you'd rather not wade through everything I read to find the good bits, I've started "starring" items I found insightful and/or think are of more general interest. Here's the feed: [http://www.instapaper.com/starred/rss/175381/ttNEuQvOmmM5sX94f0HCO7ns](http://www.instapaper.com/starred/rss/175381/ttNEuQvOmmM5sX94f0HCO7ns)
