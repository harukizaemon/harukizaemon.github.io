Every two weeks we have our iteration close during which we hold a mini [retrospective](http://www.industriallogic.com/catalogs/activities/000022.html). We break our observations into four categories:

* What Worked Well?;
* What Went Wrong?;
* What Puzzles Us?; and;
* What to Do Differently Next Time?

[Mike Melia](http://www.mikemelia.com/) made an observation that, when one works too late, they are prone to making stupid mistakes. Therefore, it's often better to go home, get a good nights sleep and tackle the problem the next day. Sage advice. Golf-claps all 'round.

Of course being the bunch of smart-arse, lazy, meeting loathing developers that we are, we decided that it was such a good point we could probably generalise it a bit and save ourselves a lot of time for the next and subsequent iteration close meetings:

* What Went Wrong? **People made mistakes**;
* What Puzzles Us? **Why do people make mistakes?**;
* What to Do Differently Next Time? **Don't make mistakes**;

And of course the one we all hope for:

* What Worked Well? **People made fewer mistakes.**

I think everyone will agree though that David (get a blog soon you git!) Pattinson does do a pretty good iteration close/kick-off especially as he is continually interrupted by people throwing stress balls around and knocking cans of coke off tables. Sheesh. Who would do such a thing I ask you? :-P
