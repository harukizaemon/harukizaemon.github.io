WOW! It's been a while since I found something non-politcal to have a good old rant about but dear god what's with facebook!? After being harassed for months with invitations by people I usually respect, I finally caved and signed up. What a load of bollocks!

So the idea is we want people to find one another. OK I got that. Then you only really want to link to friends. OK that sounds great. Then once we're connected, we can...send each other messages via a web page. Holy cow! What an idea! I wish I'd thought of that. Even better, when I receive one of these master pieces I get...wait for it...an email telling me there's a message waiting to be read. Fan-bloody-tastic.

My wife tells me I don't appreciate it because I'm not "as social as other people" I suspect it's more because I'm not bored out of my brains at work with nothing better to do with my time or my life for that matter!
