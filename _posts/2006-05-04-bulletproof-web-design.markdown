You know that feeling when you [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) a programming language so that you spend far less time thinking about the _how_ and thus are free to concentrate more on the _what_? That's how I feel about Java and it's how I'm beginning to feel about Ruby and Rails. The same can't (or I should say couldn't) however be said for (X)HTML+CSS. Until now.

Having scoured the net, read every web site I could find and even sat in bookstores for hours reading Eric Meyer, I still didn't feel comfortable doing web page layout and design. I just didn't get it. I spent so much time trying to work out _how_ I would create a web page that I lost all my creative drive. I new there just had to be a simpler way. Surely (X)HTML+CSS gives me syntactic markup + layout?!

Finally, in a last ditch effort to put myself -- and my friends on IM who I wouldn't stop bitching to -- out of misery, I spent a few hours in Borders (you know, the library with coffee) and stumbled upon [Bulletproof Web Design](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321346939/redhconsptylt-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=00T5BMX4FCT7K32KV9PJ&link_`=as1) by Dan Cederholm.

It's a pretty easy read and the examples are very easy to follow. The layout of the book makes a big difference too. I love books that I can just open at any page and get a "nugget" then read on if I feel inclined to do so or even skip back a bit to learn a bit more. This is in stark contrast to the excellent but -- for me at least -- excruciatingly painful Eric Meyer books which are too densely packed and concentrate too much on the _what_ rather than the _how_.

I'm still no expert (I've really just started) but if you too are in need of some very simple yet practical help in getting you started thinking with the right mindset, I can highly recommend it. If however you're after an HTML+CSS reference manual or an O'Reilly hacks style of book for that matter, then you might like to try something else.
