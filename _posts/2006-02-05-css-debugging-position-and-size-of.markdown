I've been getting into a lot of CSS stuff over the last couple of days and I'm really digging it; it's so much easier to lay stuff out than with tables! (OK I'm a little slow but I've never been much of an HTML man myself.)

One of the most helpful things I've learned (thanks to my mate Stuart) is that when trying to layout, position and size an element, it helps to set the background colour to something really obvious and in contrast to the rest of the page (in my case I used bright orange). This way you can see exactly where the borders and margins are.

Thanks Stu!
