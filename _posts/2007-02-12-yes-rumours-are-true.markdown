Oh, you haven't heard? Well then, let me be the first to tell you: I'm getting married on April 14th to the loverly Jesseca ;-). We're then heading to Japan (possibly via Borneo) in early June to spend 12 months in a little country town where we will hopefully spend our time telecommuting for work, travelling and partying. Oh and of course all I can eat [Aikido](http://www.iwamaaikido.com/en/index.html) training. Woohoo!

So if anyone knows of any conferences, geeky get-togethers or the like I'd love to get a little taste of the software development community in Japan.
