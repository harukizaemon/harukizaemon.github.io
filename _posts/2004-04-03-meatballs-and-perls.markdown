I thought [this article](http://www.linuxworld.com/story/44251.htm) was quite amusing, especially the comparison between dining at the JavaHut versus the Perl Cafe.

So allow me to give another perspective:

...Dusting yourself off, you walk across the street to the Perl cafe. The person at the door asks what kind of seat you want, what you want to eat, and how you want to pay. They sit you at your seat, bring over your food, collect the money, and leave you to eat in peace. You look down and realise that what they brought you wasn't what you ordered. In fact looking around, it seems everyone is eating the same dish. It's then that you realise no matter what you order at the Perl Cafe, all you ever get is **spaghetti**.

I know, I know but I just couldn't resist ;-)
