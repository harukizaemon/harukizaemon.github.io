After I posted the [last entry](/blog/2008/03/06/timepustule), I thought I'd better go share my experience with the Apple community. Let those that have been experiencing the same problems know where I'd got to.

I replied to my own discussion forum post with the following text:

> So I've changed the country setting back from Australia to the default, New Zealand and magically it appears @ 5Ghz. WTF!?Which was then automatically translated into:

> So I've changed the country setting back from Australia to the default, New Zealand and magically it appears @ 5Ghz. *****!?"**_Since when did we start treating acronyms as potentially offensive? Maybe I meant, _"Why This Fixes it? (Which of course I didn't but that's not the point.)

_"ABC!?"_ would reflect quite accurately what came out of my mouth when the piece of hardware failed to work as expected but I'm betting wouldn't be censored.
