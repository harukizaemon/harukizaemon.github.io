Not usually one to rip off someone else's quote, I couldn't resist this one. It's possibly the best description of corporate software development I've seen:

> If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering, it's certainly engineering of a sorts but it's the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did. Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. -- Alan Kay, creator of Smalltalk

If you're interested you can [read](http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=273&page=1) his other views on software development and languages.
