I stumbled upon [this paper](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Keyboard_Acoustic_Emanations_Revisited/preprint.pdf) while doing my weekly browse through articles on [CleverCS](http://ideas.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/). To quote from the abstract:

> ... a novel attack taking as input a 10-minute sound recordingof a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters...

They even run the recovered text through a spell-checker which successfully corrected a mistake in the text as it was originally typed lol.

Pretty cool idea although I figure if you can sneak a microphone into a building -- say by sending someone a bunch of flowers or a promotional desk-lamp, etc. -- you can probably just as easily "upgrade" someone's "faulty" keyboard and record keystrokes that way instead.
