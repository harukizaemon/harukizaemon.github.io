Wouldn't you know it! A week after [The Book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_`=ur2&camp=1789&tag=redhconsptylt-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0764596748) leaves the warehouse, I find a mistake in the very first figure! I'll never criticise another book EVER again. Ok, I'll criticise the book but not the author(s).

Thankfully there's an [errata page](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764596748,descCd-view_errata.html); not that I've ever visited one for a book that I've bought mind you but still, it's somewhat comforting to know.

What's particularly amusing is that the first error submitted was by me, a co-author LOL.
