When I arrived home I realised I didn't have my keys with me and my brother had (selfishly I might add) gone out somewhere. But, thanks to the wonders of modern technology here I am, sitting on the steps of my apartment building, chatting on IM, checking my email, reading RSS feeds and of course, authoring a blog entry.

What else would a geek do under the circumstances I ask?! ;-)
