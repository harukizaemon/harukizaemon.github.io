If you've been considering integrating (or replacing) your Drupal application with a Rails application, then [Drupal Fu](https://github.com/harukizaemon/redhillonrails/tree/master/drupal_fu) may come in handy.

It's pretty rough-and-ready -- I essentially just ripped the code out of an existing application and cobbled it together -- with, as yet, no plugin infrastructure, Rakefile, or anything else that might give you a degree of confidence in the quality of the code :)

That said, the code has been working in a production application for a while and we figured it might help out some others going through the same pain.
