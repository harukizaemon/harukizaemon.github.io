Nothing like waking up after a night of disturbing dreams of zombies  drinking bottles of warmed-up coca-cola. It's official. Last nights blog entry was me losing the plot. It's happened twice now in the last couple of weeks and is a sign of me becoming someone I despise. It's an indication that my ability to cope with being asked to be responsible for things over which I have little or no control is non-existant. In all my years of software development, I've honestly never felt this way. It's certainly not in my nature. I woke up this morning wishing I could have the last week all over again.

So to all those who were offended by it, I unreservedly apologise. I have deleted the entry and will make sure I go and have a beer instead next time.

FWIW, I make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. Almost everything I've ever blogged about I've done at some stage as well. That's why I write about it. I grew up with the belief that it's not a person that is wrong/stupid/whatever but the things they do. This is why I try so hard to document here all the stupid things I have done in the hope that others won't repeat them.
