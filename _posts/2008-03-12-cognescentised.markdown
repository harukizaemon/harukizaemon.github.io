As of the first of this month (March, 2008) I've become a full-time employee of [Cogent](http://www.cogent.co) leading a product development arm of the business.

I've know all the cogent guys for some time now and over the years we've all become very good friends and colleagues. Many years ago while working together, [Steve Hayes](http://www.cogent.co/about/staff.html) and I discussed starting something and whilst it sounded great in principle, my personal circumstances didn't allow for it. In the meantime, Steve and [Marty Andrews](http://www.cogent.co/about/staff.html) got their hands dirty and laid the foundation for what is promising to be a great company based on a set of values almost unheard of in, well, any industry really.

RedHill will still be around for many years to come with [Simian]/simian and [Rails Plugins](https://github.com/harukizaemon/redhillonrails/tree/master/$1) but my day to day software development will be well and truly under the Cogent banner.

So if you're in Melbourne (or anywhere in the world for that matter) and you've been looking for a someone to get your Ruby on Rails project up and out the door, we'd love to [hear from you](mailto:info@cogent.co).
