I've created [a page](https://github.com/harukizaemon/redhillonrails) where I've started to publish my rails plugins. I don't yet have a publicly accessible SVN server but I'm in the process of setting one up so, until I get that completed, I've packaged the plugins as downloadable `.tar.gz` files that you can extract into your `vendor/plugins` directory. So far I've published the [foreign-key migrations](/blog/2006/05/17/auto-generate-foreign-key-constraints-in-rails) and [cascading stylesheets](/blog/2006/05/02/more-managing-multiple-rails-environments) plugins with more to come. But as today is Norway's national day (apparently celebrating the signing of the constitution on the 17th May, 1814) and I'm in Olso, I'm off to do some drinking..ahem I mean..celebrating.
