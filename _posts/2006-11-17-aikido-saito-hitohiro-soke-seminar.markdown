I suspect many of you aren't interested in [Aikido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) nor do you live in Australia. However, for those few that are and do, I will be hosting my [teacher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitohiro_Saito) from Japan for a Seminar over the Easter Holiday weekend (6 ~ 9 April) 2007 here in Melbourne. All the details can be found in the <a href="http://www.iwamaaikido.com.au/Saito_Hitohiro_Soke_Melbourne_2007.pdf">flyer.
