So the past couple of months, I've finally had the luxury of starting to realise my (and [Cogent's](http://www.cogent.co)) dream of doing product development.

We just recently launched what we hope is a very simple, easy to use and somewhat opinionated web application for [Getting Things Done&trade; (GTD)](http://www.runwayapp.com/). It's a crowded market to be sure but we really believe we understand GTD well enough to deliver a system that is **more than just a to-do list with GTD inspired keywords**.

Runway is still in the early stages of feature development. For those that know anything about GTD, you'll be happy to hear that we're working on delivering Projects, Artifacts, Agendas and of course an Inbox, to name but a few, in the very near future.

What you see now is, and will always be, free. at some point we'll be adding pay-for features but we'll also be doing the right thing by all our early adopters. So, if you have 5 or so minutes, we'd love for you to [sign up](http://www.runwayapp.com/signup), have a play, and of course, tell us what you think.
