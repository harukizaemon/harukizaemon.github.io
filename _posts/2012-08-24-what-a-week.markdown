Six days ago, my extraordinary wife Jess gave birth to our third and final (yes, really!) child at home, a beautiful boy with a working title where his name shall shortly, hopefully, be.

Two days ago, I turned 40.

Today, I finally shipped my first iPhone app, [Readtime](http://www.readtimeapp.com), that I have been working on sporadically for a few months now with [Benjamin Birnbaum](http://twitter.com/benjaminb) and [Ben Green](http://twitter.com/bennyg), and the support of the [Cogent folk](http://www.cogent.co).

I wish I had something pithy to end with but I don't. I'm mostly just sitting here, wired, reflecting on what a crazy time it's been, how utterly fortunate I am to have the life that I do, and hoping that by writing it all down, I might finally get to sleep. I think it's worked :)

**Update**: Our son has a name: George Samuel Harris.
