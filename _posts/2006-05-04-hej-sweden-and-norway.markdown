I'll be in Oslo from the 16th until the 19th of May then in Arvika from the 19th until the 22nd and finally Stokholm from the 1st of June until the 7th of June, visiting parts unknown in between so if anyone wants to meet up for a beer and Surstromming (NOT!), that'd be cool. I'll be doing some work-related stuff as well as attending a few [Aikido](http://www.iwamaaikido.com.au) seminars. Any recommendations? Places to visit? Things to see? Hotels, Motels, Hostels to stay at (or avoid)?
