Whilst reading the latest news headlines on the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) web site just now, I happened upon what seemed like a [rather interesting article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1760531.htm) entitled **Brain fluid draining eases dementia: research**. Fascinated, I read on.

> ...The study investigated 20 patients...71 per cent of our patients improved in memory and mental function and 94 per cent improved in balance and walking...

Hang on a second...71 percent of 20 patients would be...14.2 patients; 94 percent of 20 patients would be...18.8 patients. Huh?
