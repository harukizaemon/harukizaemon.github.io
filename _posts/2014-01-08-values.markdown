It is fairly easy to formulate a set of values that sound pleasing and for which no real action is required. We might instead call these truisms.

It is much more difficult to define a set of values upon which we will act and for which we will be champion.

Harder still is finding others who share your values and your desire to act upon them, especially when values change over time.

The past while I have too readily been angered by what in hindsight was a mismatch of values. As a good friend and mentor once observed:
