Anyone who's used [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com/) will understand how cool [this](http://www.rafb.net/paste/) is. One of the guys (Mark Proctor) over at the [`haus](http://www.`haus.org) put me on to it.

As the title suggests, it allows you to paste your code and generate a unique URL for it. You can select a language, choose a "nickname", enter a description and even convert tabs to spaces if you so desire.

The result is formatted code, with line numbers, that you can easily share with others. Pretty neat.
