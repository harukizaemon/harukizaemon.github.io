Recently I've been treating my ideas as if they were drawn on an Etch-A-Sketch. A deceptively simple concept that has helped me let go of ideas that were leading nowhere but to which I had an emotional attachment that prevented me from considering anything else. Just shake and you're back with a clean slate. :-)
