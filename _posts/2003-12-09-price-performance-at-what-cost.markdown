Whenever I find myself participating in the "I love IntelliJ" versus "I love Eclipse" debate, the old "Ya can't beat price/performance" argument is rolled out faster than you can say "perspectives? what the...?". So let's do the math:

```
price / performance = 0 / anything = 0
```

or perhaps:

```
performance / price = anything / 0 = undefined
```

But seriously, Eclipse would be a great platform if I could just bend my head around to thinking the way Mr. Gamma wants me to.

It's that old mental model thing. I admit I had the same problem when I first starting using IDEA. It really comes down to what you're used to. And the fact that IDEA somehow knows what I want to do hehehe

I just thank my lucky stars I can use Eclipse 3.0. I'm even happier I don't have to use WSAD. Sheesh at AU$10,000 / seat? How many games of golf did the IBM rep have to lose to convince the "Architects" that was a good purchase? 'nuff said!

So right now, my performance is approaching new lows as I reprogramme my tiny wee brain. But I'm getting there. Though, I still sneak home for a puff of the IDEA cigar every night just to  feel that rush of endorphins again :-)
