As you're no doubt aware by now, I'm a Mac weenie (one of us, one of us, ...) and have been for 9 months or so now having switched from Gentoo Linux - I got sick of managing my irrational need to constantly upgrade and re-compile the kernel.

When I made The Switch(tm), it took me a few weeks to re-learn the keyboard so that I could get back to using mac apps the way I had used X and before that Windoze apps. I'm also an IntelliJ weenie and the one thing I've found that frustrates the hell out of me is that the keybindings (for the Mac) are totally and utterly non-standard. For example, I want to use `Command-W` to close a tab.

I know I could go in and change the keymap myself but there are probably dozens if not hundreds of commands to map and, as I'm fundamentally lazy, I figured I'd make a plea to anyone who may have performed this heroic effort already ;-). So, if anyone out there has a comprehensive Mac OS X keymap for IntelliJ, feel free to fling it my way and in return, I'll...um...sing your praises?

P.S. telling me to use Eclipse or be a real man and use VI key bindings aint gonna cut it either - I prefer IntelliJ flavoured kool-ade ;-)
