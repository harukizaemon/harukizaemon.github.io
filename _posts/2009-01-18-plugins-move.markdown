Following hot on the heels of my [blog move]({% post_url 2009-01-17-blog-move %}), I've finally moved all my rails plugins off the venerable RubyForge and onto GitHub.

Since I started working at [CogentConsulting](http://www.cogent.co) -- no we're not "The Company of ex-ThoughtWorkers" unless you count all 3 of us as somehow statistically significant -- I've had less and less time and less and less inclination to spend any appreciable effort on [RedHill](http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/) related stuff to the point where the company really exists just to support and market [Simian](/simian).

As a consequence, I've also dropped the RedhillOnRails moniker in favour of publishing the plugins under [my personal account](https://github.com/harukizaemon/redhillonrails).
