I'm usually reticent about making politically motivated blog entries but today I was having a to-and-fro via email with a friend of mine when she made a statement that, especially in light of the hoopla surrounding a certain TV show here in Australia, I felt was too good not to quote:

> It's a pity that the people who watch Big Brother don't equally scrutinise the behaviour exhibited on that other reality TV show, 'Parliament Question Time'.

Here, here.
