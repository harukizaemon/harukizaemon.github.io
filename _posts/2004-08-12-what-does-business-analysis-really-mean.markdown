Many years ago now I read the first edition of [About Face](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764526413/qid=1092227611/sr=ka-2/ref=pd_ka_2/104-0267997-9716779) by Alan Cooper. At the time, [Dave](http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/blogs/david) and I were working on an HR application which was subsequently sold to a another company and is [still being sold](http://www.dialog.com.au/asp/index.asp?pgid=10624) and (I presume) used, today.

Not to ding my own chain (much!) but it still rates as one of the best apps I've ever built. I'm sure if I looked at the source code these days I would whince but I still think we made some pretty good technical achievements. However technical merit aside the one thing that really made an impression on me and continues to make an impression was the usability of the application. Not only in terms of business functionality but also the way it simplified the way users performed their day to day tasks.

Alan Coopers most excellent insights were enlightening to me at the time and certainly influenced a lot of the design. But I can't take credit for the usability nor functionality of the application. No for that we have Dave to thank. Besides having a brain the size of a planet, he is an exceptional business analyst. _"Oh we have really good business analysts"_ I hear you cry. I'm sure you do in which case you'll appreciate my definition of a business analyst.

Picking on Dave once again, he has an amazing ability to actually analyse a business. By this I mean try to really understand what the customer does; Why they do it; Determine if their current business practices even make sense; How their shiny new software might actually make their life easier; and; most importanty to convey to (AKA convince) the customer why his ideas will work. I've heard of CEOs walking away from meetings asking their staff how this guy knows so much about their business. And I know for a fact that he had very little prior knowledge. He just knows how to ask the right questions to get to the heart of their business.

Traditionally (though I have little data to suggest this isn't still the norm) business analysts will sit with the customers and essentially document what the customer does. Workflow, day to day tasks, etc. From this they then write story cards or use cases (whatever is flavour dejour) that form the basis of the application design. These then go to the developers who consult with the customers on what exactly needs to be done, screen designs, etc. and then off they go to build the software. Unfortunately, the net result is usually a computerised version of some ancient manual system that is barely better than what they had and in many cases worse!

Maybe it's because the skills of which I write are rare but I'm not sure where the notion that customers should design the software comes from . The idea that customers know what they need (or even want) is just plain ludicrous. In most cases, business people understand what drives their business. They understand what their competitive advantage is and where they could gain new business if only they could do X or had Y. Surely it is the BAs job, nay duty, to come up to speed with the business and from that explain to the customers what would make their life easier. Surely that is where BAs add value. They understand software AND the business.

Even as a developer, I see it as my responsibility to go and talk to the BAs and customers if I see inconsistencies or if I think the application flow or business rules can be improved. I'm sure their are those who wished Id shut up sometimes but I still think it's worth it. Which brings us right back to where we started. It's very rare that the end users can design a piece of software that actually does what they need but it's equally as likely that developers will, on their own, design totally unusable software. So go read the book :-).

Oh, and [this paper](http://www.cooper.com/articles/art_goal_directed_design.htm) if you have the time.
