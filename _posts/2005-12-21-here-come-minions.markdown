Well, just as Jon (and others) [predicted](http://www.eaves.org/blog-archive/000229.html): M$ developers are apparently beginning [the move to Rails](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/19/i-made-phil-ripperger-stand-in-line-for-an-xbox-360/). That's just Marvy!

I had taken comfort in the fact that .Net had disuaded a large proportion of developers from taking up Java and had hoped (nay prayed) that it would continue to keep them amused for some years to come but alas, the secret is out. Clearly the appeal of a language that gives every developer the ability to create a train wreck faster than ever before is too much resist.

I wonder how long it will take for M$ to get a patent on Ruby (and/or Rails for that matter). It seems like the only sensible thing to do ;-)
