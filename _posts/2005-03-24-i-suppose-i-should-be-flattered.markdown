I was doing a little reading on different types of rule engines today and stumbled upon [this article](http://visualbasic.ittoolbox.com/blogs/featuredentry.asp?i=2172). As I was reading through it, I had an eerie sense of dejavou; I was sure I had read this somewhere before. In fact, it almost sounded like something I might have written.

A quick search through my blog and there it was, an [entry](/blog/2004/09/22/business-rules-scripting) posted in September 2004.

The thing that amuses me most about copying someone elses stuff word-for-word is that you inevitably end up copying all their (or in this case my) mistakes as well. So whilst I'm flattered that someone with obviously [unquestionable integrity](http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/eai/leadership/archives/003219.asp) would even consider re-using my thoughts (and even spruce them up a bit in the process) I would have thought that bloggers, armed with trackbacks and hrefs, and indeed developers in particular, would have left _copy-and-paste_  re-use behind.
