I'm about to start adding "funky" Look &amp; Feel stuff to my Rails app and I was wondering what the general consensus (if there even is such a thing) is on JavaScript libraries.

I really don't care so much about the ease or otherwise of making XMLHttpRequest calls; this is the least of my worries -- it's **trivial** to do manually. What I'm more interested in are things such as Drah &amp; Drop, Accordians, Select-as-you-type, and other more general DHTML layout stuff.

Rails itself ships with prototype+scriptaculous which I'm lead to believe are quite good. My mate [Andy](http://www.sloshydog.com/blogs/andy/) on the other-hand has [played a bit](http://www.steveweller.net/) with Dojo and likes that too.

Anyone care to share their own experiences?
