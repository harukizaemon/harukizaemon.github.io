After 25 years of software development I have come to appreciate that people are at the core of every aspect of software development.

While I will always consider myself a software developer at heart, and I am never far from the tools of the trade, I believe my greatest strength today is in bringing bringing together business, product, technology, operations, support and clients.

## 2014-Present
ANZ is undertaking project and BAU work to significantly grow their FX business into a Top 15 FX business worldwide.

As part of the ANZ Liquidity and Execution Engine (AXLE) platform providing eFX capabilities to the FX Markets business, I have been responsible for managing the development and delivery of ANZ’s global eFX high-frequency trading platform.

During this time we have:

* Built out co-location client connectivity in London and Tokyo
* Moved from quarterly to weekly releases
* Improved tick-to-trade latency from seconds to single-digit milliseconds
* Increased by two orders of magnitude the number of trading clients
* Double the number of instruments offered
* Tripled the number of securities offered
* Replaced three legacy integration platforms
* Provided on-call support 24x7
* All but eliminated non-business trade rejections
* Significantly improved overall supportability and reliability
* Split a monolithic codebase into more focused components
* Simplified the build and release process
* Introduced many high-frequency, low-latency 3rd-party components

## 2011-2014: Cogent
Primarily worked on an online learning environment [Thread] for Melbourne Business School with an accompanying iPad app.

Built [Readtime] (with Benjamin Birnbaum and Ben Green), an iPhone app for getting through your read-it-later list. Readtime has been featured in New & Noteworthy in 50+ countries as well as reviewed on sites such as Beautiful Pixels, Lifehacker, One Thing Well, and Cult of Mac.

## 2009-2011: Multinational ISV
I lead the introduction of automated testing, continuous integration, and mapping out the architecture for the next generation of their flagship product used by Local Government Authorities around Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia.

## 2008-2009: Cogent Consulting
I built [Runway], a GTD app for the web. Runway had natural language parsing for todo items including dates, times, contacts, reminders, tags, contexts, etc.

Consulting-wise, primarily lead a development team at a large publishing house using automated business rules systems to classify book content for repurposing as web site content.

## 2005: Author, Beginning Algorithms, Wrox Press
Co-authored with James Ross, Beginning Algorithms guides readers through the basics of algorithms and data structures, and examines specific algorithms that will help readers in programming tasks. In particular the examples in the book were almost entirely test-drive - an approach has drawn its fair share of criticism for being overly pedagogical.

## 2003-2008: Independent Consultant
Worked with numerous multinational and domestic organisations leading development teams, performing agile coaching, architecture reviews, etc.

## 2003: Author, Simian Code Clone/Duplication Detection Tool
[Simian] is used by hundreds of commercial and open source projects world-wide including defence departments, space research organisations and large consulting firms to detect copy&paste code in all manner of programming languages. The mathematics institute of the Netherlands even replaced their home grown-system with Simian.

I still put out minor updates to Simian every now and then as customers request enhancements or support for specific languages.

## 2001-2003: Java Practice Lead, ThoughtWorks Australia
I joined ThoughtWorks when the Australian operation was around 8 people as Java practice lead being responsible for leading teams in the development and delivery of large distributed applications as well as performing all technical pre-sales.

## 1999-2001: Independent Consultant
I spent nearly 3 years as an independent consultant working on projects for clients such as United Energy, VicRoads, and DMR (now Fujitsu). I worked as developer, team lead, coach, and often times ran Object-Oriented training courses.

## 1996-1999: Development Manager, Addease
I developed a large-scale Human Resources application—in PowerBuilder of all things—that is still in use by many recruitment companies around Australia. The team grew rapidly and I eventually became responsible for managing a team of 6 people.

## 1991-1996: Developer, Australian Systems Engineering
At ASE I taught myself 80x86 and IBM System/370 Assembler. I then set about various CPU emulators, interpreters, and compilers for proprietary languages that are still in use today.

I also assisted with the instruction of several System/370 programming courses conducted by ASE at Ferntree Computer Corporation.
